# calculate a pseudo-random number with von Neumann's middle-square method
#
#   usage: bashlets middlesquare random [SEED]
#
# if SEED is not given, use the number of seconds from the Epoch instead.
#

# a little bit of history from Wikipedia:
#
# An early computer-based PRNG, suggested by John von Neumann in 1946,
# is known as the middle-square method. It is very simple: take any
# number, square it, remove the middle digits of the resulting number as
# your "random number", then use that number as the seed for the next
# iteration. For example, squaring the number "1111" yields "1234321",
# which can be written as "01234321", an 8-digit number being the square
# of a 4-digit number. This gives "2343" as the "random" number. Repeating
# this procedure gives "4896" as the next result, and so on. Von Neumann
# used 10 digit numbers, but the process was the same.
# 
# A problem with the "middle square" method is that all sequences
# eventually repeat themselves, some very quickly, such as "0000". Von
# Neumann was aware of this, but he found the approach sufficient for his
# purposes, and was worried that mathematical "fixes" would simply hide
# errors rather than remove them.
# 
# Von Neumann judged hardware random number generators unsuitable, for, if
# they did not record the output generated, they could not later be tested
# for errors. If they did record their output, they would exhaust the
# limited computer memories available then, and so the computer's ability
# to read and write numbers. If the numbers were written to cards, they
# would take very much longer to write and read. On the ENIAC computer he
# was using, the "middle square" method generated numbers at a rate some
# hundred times faster than reading numbers in from punched cards.
# 
# The middle-square method has been supplanted by more elaborate
# generators.
